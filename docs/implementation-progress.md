# Process-learning implementation progress

The active programme is [the full implementation plan](superpowers/plans/2026-09-21-boggart-process-learning.md),
tracked in devtools as **BRAIN-1**. This record contains verified implementation
work, not future promises. Tracker criteria and commit links are the execution
status authority.

## Completed on 21 September 2026

| Ticket | Change | Verification | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| BRAIN-11 | Restrictive immutable policy scopes and corrected legacy override precedence | Fresh native build; policy 36 checks, perm 81 checks, front suite; independent review approved | `8d38645` |
| BRAIN-15 | Failed reload restores worker/module bindings and event registrations; session listing uses the actual store API and exposes errors | Rebuilt-binary lifecycle 114 checks, sessions 39 checks, real HTTP control 33 checks; independent review approved | `1470254` |

Build: `cmake --build build --target boggart -j 6` with `CCACHE_DIR` and
`CCACHE_TEMPDIR` pointing inside `build/ccache`, because the default cache
directory is outside the workspace sandbox. Tests ran through `./boggart
--eval tests/<suite>.lua`, each with an isolated temporary profile. No paid
model requests or real messaging workflows were used.

The existing user changes to judge/TypeSafe, models and completion were
preserved outside these commits. The first policy slice defines admission
decisions and quota obligations; common nested enforcement and the shared
quota ledger remain separate tickets until their own checks pass.
